# Udacity-Project-AB--Testing
Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree Project 04 - Exploring Gapminder Data using Python

***

## Description
For this project, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. 

My goal was to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
