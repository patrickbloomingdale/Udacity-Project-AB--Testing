# Udacity-Project-AB--Testing
This project is part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree

## Description
For this project, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. 

My goal was to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Rubric

### Code Quality
| CRITERIA                       | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS                                                       |
| ------------------------------ |----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Functionality of code          | All code cells can be run without error.                                   |
| Use of Good Coding Practices   | Docstrings, comments, and variable names enable readability of the code.   |

### Statistical Analyses

| Correct Interpretation of Results             | All code cells can be run without error.                                                                     |
| Correct Values for All Statistical Results    | Docstrings, comments, and variable names enable readability of the code.                                     |
| Statement of Conclusions                      | Conclusions should include not only statistical reasoning, but also practical reasoning for the situation.   |


### Submission

The jupyter notebook will be exported to pdf and ipynb, and submitted as a github repository.
